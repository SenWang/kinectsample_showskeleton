Kinect Controls

We have provided here a set of controls and samples we have used for our presentations / demonstrations. You will need to install the Microsoft Research SDK for Kinect and most likely re-reference that dll before the code will compile. Other libraries used as referenced usign a relative path to the supplied "Library" folder.
